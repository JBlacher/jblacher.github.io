                <p>The Startup Institute is an 8-week intensive training course designed to assimilate young professionals into the world of tech and startup culture. But for me... It was a game changer. </p><br />

                <p>Upon returning to Chicago from California, I lacked the necessary programming skills needed to compete with designers that were already progressing to HTML and CSS. As a graduate of the SI product track, the program not only gave me the hard skills of HTML, CSS, and jQuery so that I could compete with confidence, but also gave me experience in the different methodogies of production that startup companies follow, and the ability to network with the other professionals, and company founders, that are lifting Chicago to higher standards of tech production.</p><br />

                <p>Columbia College Chicago is a private institution that specializes in visual arts, music, film arts, and literary arts.</p><br />

                <p>As a computer animation graduate, I receive training via a few different aspects of design. Students of this program are cross-trained in a variety of areas such as 2d/3d art and design/traditional and computer animation techniques, film tech, screenwriting, and editing techniques. I also took advantage of the many free seminars and classes that Columbia offers that allowed me to cross-train myself in graphic design techniques, web and interactive design, and figure drawing.</p><br />

                <br />
                <p>My freshman year of Graphic Design was at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana before switching my major to computer animation and attending Columbia.</p><br />

                <p>The signifigance of this school is where my career as a designer almost failed before it was even began. Struggling to compete with other students from high schools with more prominent art and design departments, I was ready to search for another career had it not been a good friend and a great teacher. As I sat with them going over my drawings, they pointed out all of the details, large and small, that I overlooked compared to other students. For the next 8 months my friend and I would have nightly battles for the better drawing ranging from different topics of Superheroes and magazine layouts, or time attack drawings ranging from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. After a few weeks, I could see the difference in my work.</p><br />

                <p>This is a technique that I still use today to bring myself up to speed when learning something. The more people that I can be placed around the better and faster i will be by absorbing techniques, styles, and skills from those around me.
