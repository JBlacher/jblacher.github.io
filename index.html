		<p>Hello, my name is <b>James Blacher</b>, and I am a freelance graphic artist working in the city of Chicago.</p>

		<h3>Then and Now</h3>

		<p>I started my career working freelance for a small production 
			company that turned into a fulltime<br />job where I got to wear 
			many hats. Originally hired to do 3d modeling and animation, my 
			job soon<br />grew to include graphic arts, flash web design, 
			print design, and motion graphics. Like most graphic<br />artist 
			out there our job has expanded to learning markup and coding 
			languages. Im looking forward<br />to a new challenge as a front- 
			end developer.
