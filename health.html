                <p>After the premature loss of a friend in 2011, I started to take my health seriously. After my own extensive research and coming to the conclusion that most people, including myself, didn't have a clue what good health means, I made it my own personal mission to find the meaning of good health and wellness. Many people questioned why I would think that I need to go on a diet, but the reality is skinny definitely doesn't equal healthy. The choices we make when it comes to what we put in our bodies through food and drink, and on our bodies through products and exposure to the air we breathe have a direct impact on our health. Some things are out of our control, but common colds and illness from a low immune system can usually be prevented. Good health and wellness are more than just a salad and a smoothie every day. To consider oneself healthy and well, there must be consideration or diet, physical condition, mental condition, as well as spiritual.</p>

                <p>A complete change in lifestyle has worked wonders for other parts of my life, including motivation, the most important element required to achieve any goal. Having the motivation to break a sugar addiction, along with giving up a considerable amount of foods that I enjoyed eating and becoming aware of my daily diet has also trained me how to stick to other goals in my life and achieve them. There are no such things as bad habits, there is just lack of motivation to change. </p>
