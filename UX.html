                <br />
                <p>Problem: Doctors feel patients dont remember the vital information they are given during the examination. Patients feel as thought they can not remember the vital information given to them during the examination about their condition.</p><br />
 
                <p>Solution: A white label website/mobile app with physician supported information regarding, cardiology, diabetes, neurology, and rheumetology.</p><br />
 
                <p>Rapid prototyping for this project was done in Illustrator, Photoshop, and Invisionapp. The project was done through Lean methodology with problem/solution interviews, and usability testing drove several iterations of the project over 7 weeks.</p><br />
 
                <p>Requirements of this project before production:</p>

                <ul class="requirements">
                  <li>Contextmedia supplied videos</li>
                  <li>Assessment screening tools for patients of varying levels of conditions</li>
                  <li>Recommended products.</li>
                  <li>Check the next appointment.</li>
                  <li>Easy navigation and simplistic design for a demographic of patients ages 25-70.</li>
                </ul> <br />


                  <p>5 member team consisting of 1 sales, 1 marketing, 2 product design, 1 web developer.</p><br />
 
                  <p>The screenshot is the final iteration of the project based on the solution interviews and usability test.</p>

                    <li>Multi-featured website with attractive design while maintaining simplicity for older users.</li>

                    <li>Satisfy 2 different clients with different wants and needs simulteneously</li>
                  </ul><br />

                  <p>This was the first iteration of the website. Due to time constraints of the project we started designing before the first problem interviews. This iteration was laying out the features needed. (Not all screens present.)</p>

                <br />

                <p>The resources category evolved the most from start to finish. After running into problem with the correct wording and the doctors negative views of pushing products to patients, the resources section became a place to fulfill the need of patients to connect with others who have the same conditions. </p><br />

                <p>Through the patient solution interviews we were able to determine recommeded products were not as important to patients as connecting to other who have the same condition. However, we found that patients would prefer to do this anonymously, as most do not seek out friendships or face-to-face interactions. The resources page maintained a few products such as digital apps, and recommended reading such as cooks books, and nutritional guides, the real focus became centered around support groups that could be found on and offline, as well as popular blogs with vetted information.</p>

                <p>The testimonial section was not one of the original features that was added in response to the patient solution interviews. Patients mentioned that it was a welcome feature to hear inspiring stories from other people who share the same trials and tribulations of conditions that they live with every day. </p><br />

                <p>Patients were quick to add that although doctors are capable of treating the disease physically, they are sometimes not aware and cant relate to the emotional and mental impact that a terminal disease has on a patient.</p><br />

                <p>There were concerns from a few office managers/doctors about these videos coming from their patients, but Contextmedia's video library contains testimonial videos from vetted sources which became an easy solution to overcome this problem.</p>

                <p>The ability to check the next scheduled appointment was one of the most valued features of the website according to the patient solution interviews. There were some concerns to HIPAA when it comes to the amount of patient information that is displayed on the web.</p><br />

                <p>It was determined that patients would need to login with more than just a user name and password for added security, as well as, the end result would ping the doctors office to send the appointment information to the patients email.</p><br />

                <p>Patients are not allowed to set up a new appointments through the website.</p>

                <br />

                <p>One of the requirements of the platform was the need for a mobile solution, which we planned to design the original website responsively. The overall color of the website was changed to purple to avoid the eye strain associated with a white background on a smaller screen and smaller font. </p><br />

                <br />

                <p>This first project in UX/UI taught me the importance of the craft. Web design has drastically changed from putting a webpage on the internet and hoping people will come and visit. There is a true science in the way people move through a website, what it is that keeps them there, and what it is that keeps them coming back.</p><br />

               <p>The single most important thing that was learned about UX is that a majority of the time it is impossible to be both the user and the designer at the same time. As we learned from our problem and solution interviews, the two sides found value in different features that were available for separate reasons. But it was through these interviews and the usability test that we began to find a common ground amongst the patients, then amongst the physician, until we were finally able to settle on a common ground for most of the users coming to the website.</p><br />

               <p>We as designers, would have never been able to pinpoint ourselves some of the things that would be considered valuable or the features that would set our website apart from every other website marketed to the terminally ill. For some of us, this was the first project that we've ever been associated that was not about promoting a product or creating a service, but was centered around the social impact of helping people and making the proper and relevant information available for everyone.</p><br />
